# Text Editors and Navigating the Terminal

### **Text Editor:** Software that allows you to edit basic text

Software examples
> Notepad (windows)  
> Notes (OSX)

### **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). IDEs will typically integrate the following utilities
- Source code editor
- Debugger
- Local build automation

Software examples
> Visual Studio Code  
> Xcode  
> Atom  
> pyCharm  

After viewing the example software I am most impressed with Visual Studio Code and Atom. There is a lot of plugin integration for both of these applications that could definitely help speed up and streamline coding. 

## Terminal Navigation

Navigating the terminal allows you to explore files through a command line rather than a GUI. Below is a cheat sheet to help with common terminal navigation commands 


| Command                    | Result                                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| cd [path]                  | change your current directory to the specified one              |
| cd ~                       | go to your home folder                                          |
| cd -                       | go the the folder you were before                               |
| ls                         | list the contents of the directory                              |
| ls -lh                     | list the contents of the directory in a human-足fri足endly format |
| cp [origin] [desti足nation] | copies the given file wherever you want to                      |
| mv [origin] [desti足nation] | moves or renames the given file                                 |
| pwd                        | get the current directory you're in                             |
| mkdir [name]               | create a folder                                                 |
| mkdir -p [name]            | create a folder and all its parents, if needed                  |
