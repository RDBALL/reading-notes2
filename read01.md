# Markdown notes

The Markdown design document is a simple syntax that can be used to stylize basic web based text. Using this syntax you can implement styling choices such as bold text, italicized text, strikethrough and a few other design choices. If you have ever replied to a post on a forum or used messaging apps on your phone you have more than likely already been exposed to using markdown for formatting .

Here are a few resources that demonstrate how you can use the markdown syntax to help format text that is published in a “.md” file
